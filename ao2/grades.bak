;; (cs135-grade self-check assign mt1 mt2 final)
;;    Produces the final grade one will have, either
;;    being the sum of self-check, assign, mt1, mt2, final
;;    or the lowest between the 46 and the sum if
;;    the final exam (final) or the assigmnents (assgn) grades
;;    are lest then 50 inclusive
;; Examples:
(check-expect (smallest (cons 5 empty)) 5)
(check-expect (smallest (cons 5 (cons 2 empty))) 2)

;; smallest: (listof Num) -> Num
(define (smallest lon)
  (cond [(empty? (rest lon)) (first lon)]
        [(cons? lon)         (min (first lon)
                                  (smallest (rest lon)))]))

;; Tests
(check-expect (smallest (cons -5 (cons 2 (cons 10.5 empty)))) -5)
(check-expect (smallest (cons 0 (cons 0 empty))) 0)
(check-expect (smallest (cons 33 (cons -20 (cons -19 empty)))) -20)
(check-expect (smallest (cons 912 (cons 999 empty))) 912)
(check-expect (smallest (cons -1.5 (cons 2.2 empty))) -1.5)
(check-expect (smallest (cons 5.52 (cons 4 empty))) 4)
