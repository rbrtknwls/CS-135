 (Any, Num, Int, Nat, Bool, Str, Char, and Sym)

General Comments:

1) Make sure names are good (lower case with dashes)
2) Make sure indentation is proper
3) Define constants used
4) Make sure functions have comments and at least 2 spaces between them
5) Have a seperater


Example Format:

;; (sum-of-squares p1 p2) produces the sum of       ; <--- Purpose
;;     the squares of p1 and p2
;; Examples:                                        ; <--- Examples
(check-expect (sum-of-squares 3 4) 25)
(check-expect (sum-of-squares 0 2.5) 6.25)

;; sum-of-squares: Num Num â†’ Num                    ; <--- Contract
(define (sum-of-squares p1 p2)                      ; <--- Function Header
   (+ (* p1 p1)                                     ; <--- Function Body
       (* p2 p2)))

;; Tests:                                           ; <--- Tests at least 4)
(check-expect (sum-of-squares 0 0) 0)
(check-expect (sum-of-squares -2 7) 53)

Explination:

Purpose: Shows what each function does, dont use purpose, only should have a single purpose
Examples: Shwos the bassic use cases of the function
Contract: Shows which types are valid inputs, you may also need to add a requires
Tests: Make sure they run over every possible case for (cond) and they test boundries

Helper functions only need a purpose contract and an example!
